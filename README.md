# Weather API

## Introduction
The Weather API is a RESTful service built with Spring Boot that provides real-time weather information for various locations.
The API uses IP2Location to automatically determine the user's location based on their IP address, delivering localized 
weather data seamlessly. Additionally, a caching mechanism is employed to enhance performance by reducing redundant external API calls.
